     <p>Coffee talk is a casual game, where you play as the owner of a little coffee shop in a world where different species interact with each other. The story plays out through a couple of weeks as each day you make customers their coffee orders and learn about their stories, meeting new and quirky characters most days. The game touches on balancing work and time to yourself as well as showing how the different races or species still have prejustice against each other, and how they are trying to fix the corrupt system and make everyone equal. It has such and interesting and touching story to it, which makes it definitely worth a playthrough at least, though there are so many more little bits and pieces to the story and it can be played multiple times to find out some of these interesting additions.</p>

     <h3>Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion</h3>

     <p>Turnip boy commits tax evasion is a quirky little 2D pixel game, where you play as turnip boy and adventure across the land in an attempt to both destroy all the tax documents and to get your propety back from the mayor who has taken it due to your tax evasion. It's a enjoyable game to play the mechanics are simple and quite similar to early legend of zelda gameplay. The story is equal parts interesting and funny, as it often pulls in little easter eggs from other games and media. The characters design are so cute and appealing, you'll fall in love them immediately and want to help them complete quests, which also reward you with a range of things. My favourite of the things you can earn in the game are the collectable hats that you can use to customise turnip boy.</p>
     <P> As well as collecting items during the main story, you can go back and play multiple times to unlock even more content in the core game, as well as gaining access to a continuous fight arena type place. You board the train and progress through the carriages battling monsters until you're beaten, depending on where you got to you will earn a certain amount of tokens which you can spend on more items in the shop area just beside the entrance to the train.</P>

     <h3>Still There</h3>

     <p>Still there is a space based puzzle game, where you play as an astronaut living a seemingly monotonous life. The more you progress in this game, tackling puzzles and interacting with your environment, the more of the mystery surrounding the characters is unraveled. The gameplay is compelling and the story will really grab your attention, be prepared to feel a rollercoaster of emotions as you experience the metaphoric gameplay. Play this game a second time and you'll see it with different eyes, realising all the subtle hints that surround you that you missed the first time.</p>
