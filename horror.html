     <p>Dead By Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer online horror game with a suprising amount of story and lore behind it, however, you have to dig for it and complete tasks in order to unlock some of the deeper parts. While playing the game itself you don’t get the story in any way other than via the environment, depending on which area you spawn in as this can change depending on a variety of factors, such as the killer you are playing as or against and the totem items that the players can choose to play in order to change the area or other variables within the game. </p>

     <p>The game consists of 5 players max, 4 of which are survivors who are tasked with getting generators running in order to escape from the level. The remaining player is the killer, whose task is to hunt down all of the survivors and sacrifice them to the entity before they have a chance to escape. Both survivors and killers come in a variety of characters, all of which come with different perks and skill sets that can give the player small advantages</p>
